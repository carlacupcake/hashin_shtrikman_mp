## How to use the cython code
1. Use python3.9
2. Make sure you have `cmember.pyx` in your working directory.
3. Run `python setup.py build_ext --build-lib cbuilds`
4. This will create `cmember.c` and `cmember.cpython-39-darwin.so`
5. Make sure to include `from cmember import CMember` in sny files that require the cythonized member class

We'll move the methods that should be cythonized outside of the Pydantic model, and use composition to call these methods from the Pydantic model. This way, the performance-critical methods can still be cythonized while keeping the Pydantic model intact.
