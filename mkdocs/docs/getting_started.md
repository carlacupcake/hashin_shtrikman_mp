## Getting Started
Getting familiar with any codebase can be difficult and learning by example is often the most efficient. Toward this end, we have provided two example Jupyter notebooks: <br>

* `example_n=3.ipynb`: an example which explores searching for a 3-phase composite with user-specified desired properties <br>
* `example_plotting.ipynb`: an example demonstrating the different phase diagram visualizations for 2-, 3-, and 4-phase composites
